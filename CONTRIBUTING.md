# Contributing

These guidelines are designed to help you as a contributor to bring your code and skills to the XPlat Windows APIs project to make it better.

## What can I contribute to?

Our [issue tracker](https://github.com/jamesmcroft/XPlat-Windows-APIs/issues) contains a collection of features and issues waiting to be worked on! If you see any item marked with **Help Wanted**, we'd like to see you put your skills to use and contribute whatever you can to help develop the feature.

This can be in the form of contributing to the conversation around the feature or issue, providing code and submitting a pull request, adding a new feature request or bug, or even helping to update our documentation. 

We know that not everyone can do everything, so any little helps. If you can only develop the iOS or Android component but not the other, that's fine! We accept any contribution whether big or small.

## Code Styling

We do have a coding style in place, but as a contributor, we're happy for you to code in a way that makes your feel comfortable. We will do the work to make sure everything is in tip top shape before we release to the public.

## Bug Hunting

We're more than happy for you to contribute to our project through testing. We're all developers and we often miss things so finding bugs in the project's code is definitely approved of. Please remember to start a new issue in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/jamesmcroft/XPlat-Windows-APIs/issues) so we can keep an eye on them and get bugs fixed.

Even better, if you know how to fix it, follow up your issue with a pull request!

## Testing And Documentation

We're including unit tests for the project. While we will aim to have the best coverage as possible across the entire project, it could always be improved on. If you find an area that is missing tests or could have more tests for, feel free to raise an issue or help out by writing some tests!

As well as testing, we aim to document the entire project in terms of both developer guidelines such as these and our own API documentation. If you find something that is wrong or is missing, again, feel free to raise an issue or contribute towards the documentation.
